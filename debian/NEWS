python-boto (1.1c-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Boto now defaults to using the virtual bucket hosting server API for
  Amazon S3. A by-product of this is that bucket names must adhere to the
  same rules as host names in DNS, most notably that they are treated as
  case-insensitive. This means that it is impossible to access existing
  buckets which have names containing upper-case characters without
  resorting to the old-style calling format.
  
  You can enable the older calling format by passing an instance of
  boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat when creating connection 
  objects using the "calling_format" keyword. For example:

    from boto.s3.connection import OrdinaryCallingFormat
    from boto import connect_s3
  
    con = connect_s3(key, secret, calling_format=OrdinaryCallingFormat())
